# Welcome to the Virtualization Platform Evaluation Project

## About This Organization

This organization is dedicated to a Master's project in Software Engineering exploring:

**"What Makes an Effective Configurable Test Harness for Comparative Virtualization Platform Evaluation?"**

## Project Overview

This research project investigates the design and implementation of configurable test harnesses for evaluating and comparing different virtualization platforms. The goal is to identify the key characteristics that make a test harness effective for:

- **Performance benchmarking** across multiple virtualization technologies
- **Reproducible testing** with consistent, configurable parameters
- **Comprehensive evaluation** of virtualization platform capabilities
- **Comparative analysis** to guide platform selection decisions

## Research Focus

The project examines critical aspects of test harness design including:

- Configuration flexibility and extensibility
- Measurement accuracy and reliability
- Platform-agnostic testing approaches
- Automation and scalability
- Results analysis and visualization
